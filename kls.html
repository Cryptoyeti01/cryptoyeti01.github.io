        <h2>Setting up wallet and obtaing a KLS address</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            Download the client: <a href="https://github.com/karlsen-network/karlsend/releases">
            https://github.com/karlsen-network/karlsend/releases</a></li>
        <li>
            Unzip files and put somewhere you can easily find them. I just create a dedicated directory like 
            C:\Karlsen and place them all in there.</li>
        <li>
            Open up a command prompt or powershell and change to the Karlsen directory (i.e. cd C:\Karlsen). <br>
            Type in the command:  karlsend.exe --utxoindex <br>
            This will start the node and sync it to the blockchain. Note that it may take some time to fully sync up with the network.
        </li>
        <li>Open up a new command prompt or powershell (leave previous window open) and change to the Karlsen directory (i.e. cd C:\Karlsen). <br>
            Type in the command:  karlsenwallet.exe start-daemon <br>
            This will start the wallet daemon in order for you to execute the next steps.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Create a new wallet</h4><br>
            Type in the command:  karlsenwallet.exe create <br>
            This will create a new wallet keyfile.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Reveal and save your seed words</h4><br>
            Type in the command:  karlsenwallet.exe dump-unencrypted-data <br>
            This will display your newly created wallets seed words. Write these down and keep them safe. <br>
            These words can be used to recreate your wallet if it becomes corrupted. Be careful as anyone who has these words can also gain access to your coins.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Create a new receiving address</h4><br>
            Type in the command:  karlsenwallet.exe new-address <br>
            This will create a new wallet receiving address you can send KLS coins to.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Check balance</h4><br>
            Type in the command:  karlsenwallet.exe balance <br>
            This will display the balance of the address you created above. <br>
            Alternatively, type in the command:  karlsenwallet.exe balance -v<br>
            The addition of the -v flag will display all addresses with a balance. 
            This is useful to also display change balances once you made a few transactions. <br>
        </li>
